Breeona: I contributed by writing the scale() and add() functions, as well as the testScale() and testAdd() functions. I took thirty minutes to complete my portion. I had no troubkle with the coding part, but I did have an issue with pushing to the repo at first.

Josh: I contributed to writing the JUnit test functions for the dot() and magnitude() functions, as well as implementing those functions in the main Vector3D class
itself. The function of these functions was to compute the dot product of two vectors and the magnitude of a vector, respectively. All in all the functionality 
testing of the test and driver functions took aproximately 24 minutes. The 3 meetings that our team held totaled 3 hours and were used to primarily fix 
and address issues with merging branches as well as pulling and pushing conflicts. In the final meeting I spent ~15 minutes fixing a build path/ package-import conflict.
