Breeona: I contributed by writing the scale() and add() functions, as well as the testScale() and testAdd() functions. I took thirty minutes to complete my portion. I had no trouble with the coding part, but I did have an issue with pushing to the repo at first.

Alex: I contributed by writing the toString and equals() methods, as well as testToString() and testEquals() methods. I took thirty minutes to complete my methods. I had some trouble with the coding just from what was asked from the rubric, other than that I encountered no problems

Josh: I contributed to writing the JUnit test functions for the dot() and magnitude() functions, as well as implementing those functions in the main Vector3D class
itself. The function of these functions was to compute the dot product of two vectors and the magnitude of a vector, respectively. All in all the functionality 
testing of the test and driver functions took aproximately 24 minutes. The 3 meetings that our team held totaled 3 hours and were used to primarily fix 
and address issues with merging branches as well as pulling and pushing conflicts. In the final meeting I spent ~15 minutes fixing a build path/ package-import conflict.

Elisha: I contributed to the writing of our project by creating the subtract() and negate() moethods in the Vector3D class. 
Additionally, I wrote the testSubtract() and testNegate() functions in Vector3DTest (these functions were written first as we were doing Test Driven Development).
Writing the functions and their tests initially took me 35 minutes and then the editing of these later on added another 15 minutes, so 50 minutes total.
